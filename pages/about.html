                <h1 class="cover-heading">About Me</h1>
                <p class="p">Hello,</p>
                <p class="p">My name is Ella Suprise! I am the teacher at The Beehive Preschool. My family consits of my husband, Michael and our puppy, Lucy. I love spending time with my husband and puppy, we take her on walks and to the dog park often. I love photography, do it yourself projects/crafts, spending time with my family, and of course preschool.</p>
                <p class="p">I have known that I wanted to teach children since I was 12 and had the opportunity to volunteer in a kindergarten classroom for a couple months and I ended up going back the next school year too. I discovered through this wonderful experience that teaching children was what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p class="p">To make a long explanation short I was not able to graduate in my long desired dream degree of early childhood education that I set out to receive when I started my college journey. I ended up changing my degree and completed my education online through BYU Idaho and graduating with a bachelor’s degree in marriage and family studies. This was a great blessing for me and I learned a lot of valuable knowledge however, my desire to teach children has never left me.</p>
                <p class="p">In addition to the kindergarten classroom and teacher who started it all, I had the opportunity to volunteer in a different kindergarten classroom for three months. I have also worked as a kindergarten classroom aide for two school years. The teacher I worked with taught me so much and allowed me to teach and grow my skills as an educator. I loved it! I am beyond grateful to her and the other two kindergarten teachers who I was able to learn from.</p>
                <p class="p">One of the greatest things that brings me joy is seeing children learn while having fun. I am thrilled to be able to finally start my own preschool and have the opportunity to be the teacher, plan the lessons, and have my own classroom. It is a dream of mine that is coming true. I’m so happy for you and your child to be a part of it.</p>
