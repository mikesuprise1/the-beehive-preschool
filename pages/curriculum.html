				<h1 class="cover-heading">Curriculum Overview</h1>
				<p class="p">The school curriculum follows the Utah Core Standard for Early Education-PreK and will ensure that children are confident when they enter the magnificent world of kindergarten. Lasting learning cannot, nor should it, be rushed. That is why I believe in learning that is done at the child’s pace. I will give each child the assistance they need to feel confident in their learning abilities and within reason will not move on to additional material until all the students are ready. In our classroom we do a variety of activities and make sure that there is a lot of hands on learning.</p>
                <p class="p">Each day is different however generally a typical day in our classroom will follow this outline:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="p">Welcome to the day</p>
                    <li class="p">Sharing good news or something we are grateful for</p>
                    <li class="p">Calendar/Today’s weather</p>
                    <li class="p">Story time/Story discussion</p>
                    <li class="p">Letter activities</p>
                    <li class="p">Snack time</p>
                    <li class="p">Quiet/reading time</p>
                    <li class="p">Numbers/Shapes/Math</p>
                    <li class="p">Craft or Science Activity</p>
                    <li class="p">Free play/Socializing with friends</p>
                </ul>
                <h1>Preschool Philosophy</h1>
				<p class="p">The Beehive Preschool is a West Jordan Utah in-home preschool for children ages 3-5 years old. In a fun, safe, and educational environment children will learn developmentally appropriate skills and academic knowledge through play, books, crafts, music, games, and more! I seek to best help your child’s development socially, emotionally, physically, and cognitively while they attend The Beehive Preschool. I believe that each child needs individual attention and learns best when they are able to receive individual attention, that is why our class sizes will not exceed 6 students.</p>
				<p class="p">As I observed when I worked in a kindergarten classroom a child’s success in learning accelerates when parents and teachers work together. I look forward to working with you to help your child have the best experience learning. I will be open to questions and assist you to the best of my ability. I will also send home progress reports monthly with suggestions on things to work on with your preschooler.</p>
                <p class="p">As a preschool teacher my three main ambitions are to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Teach children to think in a growth mindset. This is vital for each child to learn because it helps them to see challenges as opportunities to grow/learn and not as overwhelming events that make them want to quit and give up.</li>
                    <li>Help children grow their love of learning. I know that children already naturally love learning, they want to explore, are curious, and excellent question askers. My purpose is to make sure that joy and love of learning continues to grow inside them.</li>
                    <li>Have every child at the end of their preschool experience be excited and ready for kindergarten. This is the reason for preschool. I look forward to helping your child be academically, socially, and emotionally ready for kindergarten. Since I have experience in kindergarten classrooms I have a first-hand knowledge of what is expected of those kindergarten students.</li>
                </ol>
				<p class="p">The fundamental foundation of learning is laid in these developmentally crucial years of life and I am excited to be a part of that for your child.</p>
